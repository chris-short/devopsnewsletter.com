DevOps Newsletters is an idea that sprung out of an opensource.com article: [16 blogs and newsletters to follow for DevOps practitioners](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/devops-blogs-newsletters-follow)

> Keeping up with trends in the fast-paced world of DevOps is challenging. I might be dating myself, but I remember a time before there was a difference between front-end and back-end coders. Now, there is so much technology it makes little sense to try to keep up with everything.

> DevOps and systems folks have less of a need to keep up with the day-to-day doings of front-end work. The inverse applies to front-end folks. Both disciplines are equally difficult to master, and to excel in either one requires an enormous amount of self-discipline. Regardless of what discipline you follow, it helps to stay current. Being well-read means reading long-form pieces as well as short-form ones such as blogs, newsletters, and occasionally social media posts.

DevOps Newsletters intends to be a one stop shop for the best DevOps content from around the world.
